The deep learning algorithms  is applied to 
distinguish gamma-ray bursts.   
This directory contains dataset, deep learning algorithms, and candidates.   
The samples in the dataset are count map consisting of light curves for each energy band, which extracted from the observation data of [Fermi/GBM](https://gammaray.nsstc.nasa.gov/gbm/).  
The deep learning algorithms is convolutional neural network. 
The candidates are the possible GRBs found from one year observations (20210701-20220701) of Fermi/GBM by applying the optimal model.
